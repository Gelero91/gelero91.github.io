map editor :
- works by layer : map,sprites, teleports.
- chose the height of the starting point of map, it will be modified by teleporting in other rooms
- Chose the walls in the palet, and click on the disired tile
- same logic with the sprites, chose a type instead.
- some sprites are PJG, Merchants or enemies. Chose their properties before clicking on the tile.
- the teleporters are made of two points (A and B), representing a door. You have to chose the orientation desiried for each points.
- the teleporters are also responsible of chanching the height of the walls, the ceiling or the skybox
- Export in JSON format - manually implement in raycaster (for now - more map system to come)
